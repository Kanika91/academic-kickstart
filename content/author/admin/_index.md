I am a 5th year PhD student in the Data Mining Group at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am advised by [Prof. Hari Sundaram](http://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/) and closely
work with [Prof. Alexander Schwing](https://alexander-schwing.de). I have also worked as a Technical Staff Member (Research) in Information Management and Analytics group at [IBM Research Labs, India](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/).


My research interests are broadly in the area of User Behavior Modeling, Graph Neural Networks and Credibility on Social Media. Specifically, I work on computing time sensitive and socially-aware user representations that are used for a wide range of tasks like finding
credible answers in crowdsourced platforms and recommender systems.
